                    <strong>Obama Re-elected</strong>
                    <p>The country voted about 5 percentage points more Republican in 2012 than in 2008. Obama lost North Carolina and Indiana, but won every tossup except Florida, which remains too close to call.</p>

                    <p>Ohio, which has voted for the winner in every election since 1964, provided the decisive electoral votes in 2004, and it is the state likeliest to play that role again this year, according to the FiveThirtyEight model.</p>

                    <strong>Incumbent Stability</strong>
                    <p>When an incumbent runs for re-election, fewer states typically change party affiliation: only three states shifted from 2000 to 2004, and five from 1992 to 1996. Yet incumbency is no guarantee of victory. Bill Clinton defeated the
                        first President George Bush by winning 22 previously Republican states.</p>

                    <p>In 1976, Jimmy Carter had one of the largest home-state advantages in history. This advantage is one possible reason the Romney campaign hopes to capture Representative Paul D. Ryan’s home state, Wisconsin, this year.</p>
